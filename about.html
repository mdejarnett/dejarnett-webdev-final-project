        <p class='aboutme'>Orion Experimental is an artist and project management service run by Megan DeJarnett, a Los Angeles-based composer-trumpeter who has spent her life in the thrall of a good story. Throughout her musical training, she has prioritized communication—the composer telling a story to the performer or audience through the score, the performer commenting on the music aurally or visually, and the audience’s response to a piece all figure prominently in her creative practice. Megan has dedicated herself to the creation and performance of new music, collaborating with composers around the world as a soloist and a co-founder of Phantom Collective, a student-run chamber brass ensemble at CalArts. Megan’s creative work focuses on bridging the gaps between composer, performer, and audience through physical, idiomatic, and textual means. She hopes Orion Experimental will engage audiences with new and interdisciplinary forms of artmaking in order to further their own understandings of the world and themselves.</p>
        <p class='aboutme'>Megan holds a BM in Theory and Composition from Arizona State University and is currently in pursuit of her MFA in the Performer-Composer program at CalArts. She is constantly seeking out new collaborators; her work can be found <a href="https://megandejarnett.com" target="_blank">on her website</a>.</p>
